To read the word chart, start from the bottom left corner and works from bottom to top.The full Abstract Spring peyote pattern is shown here in three different color variations.

The Abstract Spring pattern is designed using software called Bead Tool 4 which offers a free download as well as a paid version that has more features. Using bead design software is the easiest way to design patterns.

One of the best features of the software is how easy it is to change the color palette of a design. You can always change the colors you use on any pattern--it&apos;s just that when you use software, it allows you to preview the results before you have stitched it up.

Bead Tool 4 comes with the color palettes of Miyuki, Toho and Preciosa beads pre-loaded in the software, so you just need to select the colors to add to the design. You can also pre-load the beads in your inventory into the tool. This feature is useful for you to make sure you design using bead colors that you already own, or to help you substitute colors.The Abstract Spring color variations vary the look of the pattern by applying light and dark backgrounds as well as tonal color variations in the design. The information on the beads used in these patterns is available for download at the link.

All of the bead colors listed for the peyote stitch designs are Delica beads since they provide the evenest results when using peyote stitch. If you don&apos;t mind a more freeform (i.e. slightly uneven) beadwork bracelet, other beads can be used, but do your best to cull the beads to give yourself similar sizes and shapes to work with. Vastly different sized beads will make the band uneven and possibly expose the thread, making it more likely to fray.</string>

				<string>Are these lovely dangle earrings a bunch of trailing flowers or falling snowflakes? The great news is that you can decide when you make these earrings! Choose bright saturated colors for summer ready baubles, warm earth tones reminiscent of Fall&apos;s palette, or cool blues like the earrings pictured to make a pair that is summer or winter appropriate.

The highlight of this design is a huichol inspired beaded flower variation that dangles on a sparkling stem of beads.  For these earrings, you will need:

Six colors of size 11 Czech seed beads
Fireline beading thread
Two closed jump rings
Two earring wires
Beading needle
Scissors
Czech beads are the ideal type of seed beads for this project because of their round shape and wide variety of colors, including multiple shades in a single color family. Cylinder beads will result in angular lines that will expose more thread.

Fireline is a fishing thread that is also sold as beading thread, and is perfect for this project. Ten pound fireline is thin enough to pass through each bead multiple times and will also help stiffen the project to result in firm, not floppy, flowers.

These earrings start by making the flower and then adding a sparkly beaded stem to suspend them from jump rings attached to the ear wires.Make a circle of twelve silver seed beads and tie a square knot to secure. Then stitch through one more bead to hide the knot in a bead. Pick up five seed beads, one light blue, three medium blue, and one more light blue, as shown. Place your needle into the second silver seed bead in the circle, skipping one bead.

Continue this pattern of picking up seed beads and stitching into every other bead all the way around the circle.When you have completed the circle, you will need to &quot;step up&quot; to start the next round. Stepping up is stitching through beads that you previously added to position your thread for the next row. 

After the last step, your thread is exiting a silver bead in the center. Stitch through the first two blue beads you added to position your thread to start the next set of beadwork stitches.To make the next section of the petals, round two of three, pick up one medium blue, one dark blue, and another medium blue bead. Skip the middle bead and stitch into the second bead from the previous round. Pull thread tight.To keep the thread from showing between petals, an accent colored bead is added. Pick up one brown bead and put your needle in the second blue bead from the first round. Continue this pattern of alternating between adding three blue beads and one brown colored bead until you have worked all the way around the circle.After you complete the prior round, stitch into the first blue bead you added in the last round. Your needle is now in position to start the third and final round of the flower petals.There can be two different variations for this round:

If you like a rounded, slightly larger flower petal, pick up four dark blue seed beads for each stitch.
If you like a more angular flower, pick up three dark blue seed beads for each stitch.
If you look at the finished earrings, the long dangle uses four beads on the final round and the shorter dangle uses three beads. The difference is slight, but combining both flowers, or using slightly different colors, can add interest to your finished earrings.

Pick up three seed beads, skip the middle dark blue bead, and put your needle into the next medium blue bead. Pull thread tight.Follow these instructions to another flower and add it to the jump ring. Add an earwire to finish your earring and then make a second one to match.

				<string>The Huichol are indigenous people of Mexico who live in the central northwest mountainous region of the states of Navarit, Jalisco, Zacatecas, and Durgango. Originally tobacco farmers, more recently the Huichol people have become known for selling their brightly colored craftwork that depict traditional designs with symbolic and religious significance.

Two types of beadwork are especially popular. &quot;Yarn Paintings,&quot; where commercial yarn coated with wax or resin are pressed onto shapes, such as bowls or masks, and then covered with individual beads to form intricate and colorful designs. The other form of beadwork is bright bead weaving designs in shapes that reflect the Huichol&apos;s respect of nature and their religious traditions. Shapes such as flowers, plants, and animals are popular.Brightly colored Czech seed beads are most often used for Huichol style beadwork. These types of beads have a round shape and the bead sizes are slightly irregular. These characteristics work well for the organic style of the Huichol that often features round shapes, such as flowers.

Czech beads come in a wide variety of colors and finishes. Although traditional Huichol designs typically use opaque beads, it is fun to experiment with these designs using combinations of transparent, metallic and opaque beads.

For most of the projects here, you will need:

Small amounts of size 11 Czech seed beads
10 pound FireLine thread
Size 11 beading needle (We prefer Tulip brand)
Scissors that are good to cut beading thread with.This daisy flower is the perfect place to start learning Huichol style beadwork. It is a simple design, very quick to make, and will teach you the basics of the circular netting stitch that is the foundation of Huichol beadweaving. It is also a great way to use up small quantities of leftover beads.

If you are a visual learner, follow along with this daisy flower picture tutorial. The step by step pictorial includes how to make a beaded chain with leaves to hang your daisy flowers on. Otherwise, follow the step-by-step tutorial, which also includes additional information how to transform the daisy shape into a star shape.It may be hard to believe, but by adding several more rounds of netting stitch to the daisy flower, you can end up with these gorgeous, show-stopping blooms. There are a variety of tutorials available to make these flowers.

The Huichol large flower tutorial we used to make these earrings is primarily visual. The instructions are in Russian, but can easily be translated to English in your browser.

There is a similar Huichol flower tutorial that has the advantage of being in English and also has a useful blank bead chart that you can print and then color to plan the bead colors you would like to use. The same site also has a video tutorial, but it is in Spanish. As you can tell from the tutorials, Huichol beadwork is popular all over the world!

				<string>DIY Beaded Hairpins and Bobby Pins</string>

				<string>Hairpins and bobby pins are a must to dress up your hair for formal events like weddings and proms. They can transform a simple updo or braid into an eye catching coiffe (also known as a fancy hairdo!).

But, there&apos;s no need to limit your use of beaded hairpins to special occasions and holidays. Use them anytime. And another great reason to make your own is that you&apos;ll have exactly the colors and styles you need to go with your outfit. There is nothing more frustrating at prom time than scouring multiple stores to find the right hairpins and coming up empty. You can avoid the disappointment with just a little planning, plain hairpins or bobby pins, some beads and wire. If you are not familiar with them both, hairpins are slightly different than bobby pins. Most people are familiar with bobby pins, which are open ended clips perfect to hold your growing-out bangs to one side or fix those pesky short pieces back for a smooth ponytail.

One thing about them that we bet you didn&apos;t know is that you are probably putting bobby pins in your hair the wrong way. Most people put the wavy side facing up, but that side is intended to be against your head, helping to provide resistance against your other hair and scalp from slipping out. The flat side of the pin is intended to face up. Once you start using them the correct way, you will never go back. And another benefit is that it makes them much easier to add beads to when you put the curvy side facing down.

Just like a hairpin turn, hairpins are U-shaped and not fully closed. You may think of them as something your grandmother used, but if you have longer hair, you should definitely give them a try. They can help keep your buns in place, smooth stray pieces of hair and add sparkle while providing hold. There are only a few tools and materials needed for this DIY. Obviously, the first thing you&apos;ll need is a hairpin or bobby pin. There are so many sizes, styles and colors to choose from, be sure to be selective and consider the hairstyle you plan to use them for.

Most beads will work for decorating hairpins, but the hole must be large enough for the wire and ideally they should be able to withstand hairspray (which typically contains alcohol). Find a thin flexible wire to attach the beads. Twenty-six gauge craft wire worked perfectly for this example; 24 gauge was too thick and was hard to wrap tightly around the hairpin or bobby pin. An even thinner wire, such as 28 or 30 gauge may also work, as long as you don&apos;t overwork it and bend it too much, which could cause it to break.

You will also need wire cutters and pointy nose pliers.Cut a piece of wire. If you are attaching a single bead, it should be about four inches long. For three beads, you will need at least six inches of wire. There will be plenty of extra wire with these measurements, but it is easier to wrap and hold tight when you have a little extra.

Add the bead and slide it to the center of the wire. Fold the wire around the back of the bead and twist the wire beneath the bead to keep it in place. Wrap the wire ends around the hairpin, one to each side of the center bead.If desired, use the wire ends to add more beads to the hairpin. Slide the bead on, leave some space for twisting or wrapping the wire and bend the wire back around the bead like you did for the first bead.It can be difficult to twist the wire around the stem to hold the bead in place. You can twist the bead, which will twist the wire, but be sure not to overdo it or the wire can snap.Wrap the wire two or three times to secure them and press the ends in place. If possible, use the pointy plier tips to squeeze the wire coils close together. The technique is similar for making a bobby pin, except instead of perching the beads on the end of the pin, you want them to lay flat across the smooth flat side of the bobby pin. You need to wrap smoothly and work in a tight space, which is why it is easier to start with making hairpins.Once you&apos;ve got the hang of it, you can make sets of hairpins or bobby pins for special occasions or gifts.</string>

				<string>This beaded lizard is simple to make and requires no special beadwork skill or knowledge. It can be done by any age level and is a favorite for summer camp craft sessions, scout group crafts, back-to-school crafts, or any time you need to keep hands busy. To adapt this craft to different age levels, you can vary the type and size of beads you use.

Print out or open the beaded lizard pattern in a separate window and follow along with these step by step instructions.The type of beads and type of string or cord you choose for your beaded lizard will determine the size and finished look—and also the suitable age group. Largely rounded beads, such as pony beads, work well for young crafters who are just getting familiar with stringing or get frustrated easily. They also work well for older crafters who have trouble seeing the small holes of other beads.

Perler beads, also called fuse beads, are a less traditional choice for this craft, but many camps, schools or parents have buckets full of them, so they are worth giving a try. They also come in the best assortment of colors. They are slightly smaller than pony beads with a shape that&apos;s similar to ​Japanese cylinder beads but on a much larger scale.

Another less traditional choice, but the one used for this example, is size 6 glass beads, also called E beads. They are smaller than the other two options and come in a wide variety of colors and sizes. These beads are a great inexpensive option and give more satisfaction for a slightly more experienced crafter—and may even make older children want to craft with their younger siblings.For each beaded lizard, you will need at least one to two yards of bead cord. The cord must easily fit through the bead twice. One yard of the cord is suitable if you are using small beads. More cord is required with larger Pony beads.

In addition, you will need small amounts (less than thirty) of two colors of beads and two more beads of a different color for the lizard eyes.Unlike most projects, the beaded lizard begins in the middle of the thread or cord. Pick up one bead and slide it to the center, so you have two equal lengths of cord on either side.Pick up the first two beads of the second row on one side of the thread. Keep them toward the thread end.  

Now pick up the other thread end and go through the beads in the opposite direction. The beads should look like the picture, with the thread going in each side of the beads and the opposite thread ends coming out the side of the beads.  Pull the thread ends to slide the two beads to the center. They should stack neatly on the first bead. Make sure your beads remain centered by comparing the tail lengths and adjust as necessary.

Adding the rest of the rows of beads for the body and tail are done the same way. Making the lizard legs is slightly different.You will use the cord from each side to make each of the lizard legs. The right cord will make the right leg, the left cord will be used to make the left leg. Pick up two beads of the first color and three beads of the second color for each leg.Skipping the last three beads, put your cord back through the two beads. Make sure you pull the bead tight and slide the beads close to the body. Arrange the three beads that make up the foot into a triangle.Continue the body of the lizard the same way you started in the beginning, by picking up the correct number of beads and placing the cord from the other side through the beads in the opposite direction.

Repeat the instructions above for the back legs of the lizard.Add one bead at a time to make the lizard tail. When you are done, you can knot your threads using either a square knot or an overhand knot. We recommend an overhand knot because we think it stays tight better.To slide an overhand knot close to the beads, insert a piece of wire or another pointy object into the knot to help slide it into place. This will keep the knot slightly unfastened so you can manipulate it into place before removing the wire and tightening the knot for good.</string>

				<string>Don&apos;t worry if you don&apos;t have any buttons for a keychain project. Beads and wire make great keychains too. It&apos;s also a great way for aspiring jewelry makers to learn how to make wire wrapped loops since the technique is the same, but nothing about these wraps has to be perfect.

The only tools you will need are wire cutters. For wire, try to find 20-22 gauge to make sure your keychain will last, but the wire is easy to bend without tools.Pony beads are a staple of kids crafts but this project takes the novel approach of melting them instead of stringing them. Plastic pony beads melt quickly in the oven to form a hard plastic disk when they cool. In this example, pony beads are melted in silicone muffin cups, which makes them easy to remove once the disks have hardened. It also gives the edges a delightful scalloped shape. One side of the disk is shiny and the other is matte, so you get the best of both worlds. Be sure to melt the plastic in muffin tins that you are no longer using for food. Drill a hole in the plastic disk and add a keychain finding to complete the project.</string>

				<string>Start your netting by stringing a stop bead. The stop bead will become part of your beadwork, so make sure it is the same type of bead that is used in the rest of your design.  Leave an appropriate sized tail thread that will allow you to add a clasp later, usually at least 6 inches.

Pick up 11 beads and go back through the seventh  bead from the end.  Pull the thread to form a loop.

This step is only done when you start the beadwork.  Future netted sections will work off of beads in the prior section.Pick up 4 beads and go down through the fifth bead.  

If this is your first component, the fifth bead is the stop bead. Pull beads tight.Pick up 9 beads and go back through the seventh bead from the end.  Pull thread tight to make a loop. Pick up 5 beads and go through the sixth bead above where your thread is exiting.

In the pictures accompanying each step, you see the shape achieved from the prior stitch, the new beads on the thread near the beadwork and the location the needle is going through for the current stitch.Pick up 3 beads and go up through the fourth bead up from your thread.

Every column in this netting component ends with picking up 3 beads and stitching into the 4th bead up from your thread.  Pick up 4 beads and go down through the 2nd of the 3 beads you just added.

This stitch is used in every column to transition from one column of beadwork to the next.  In this case, you are moving from the left column to the center picot column.

This stitch will often pull the tension of your beadwork loose.  Be sure to hold the beads and thread to keep everything snug next to each other.   Pick up 4 beads and go down through the fifth bead down from the bead your thread is coming out of. Pick up 5 beads and go down through the sixth bead down from your thread.

This bead is easy to spot since it is at the end of the column. Pick up 6 beads and go back through the fourth bead from the end.  This makes a 3 bead picot on the end.  Make sure to keep the tension tight here.

If you lose your place while beading, this is a good spot to come back and find where you left off.  ​

This is also a good place to customize your collar necklace by adding a crystal bead instead of the picot.  Instead of picking up 6 beads, pick up 3 beads, a crystal, and one more bead.  Stitch back through the crystal bead, skipping the last bead. That will put a crystal bead in place of the picot.  Crystals that are 3-4 mm in size, particularly bicones, work well for this.Pick up 5 beads and go up through the sixth bead up from your thread. Pick up 5 beads and go up through the sixth bead up from the bead your thread is coming out of.

It is easy to split the thread when you are going through on an angle.  Try to pull the bead up and keep your needle on the top edge to avoid going through the thread and weakening your beadwork. Pick up 3 beads and go up through the fourth bead up.  

This is the end of the column. Pick up 4 beads and go down through the second of the 3 beads you just added.

This is the turn to start a new column.</string>
